HospitalManagementApp

Full Stack App created using MERN stack and the CSS framework Bootstrap that is aesthetically pleasing and that allows users to create patients, doctors, and appointments as well as view them.

Get Started:

Run npm start in the frontend folder to get the client up and running on localhost in the browser. You can then view the UI livetime :)

Run npm start in the backend folder to get the server up and running listening on port <port>. It will then listen to incoming client requests and feed data from the MongoDB database! :)
